          We will look at two different models, that are still very
          <span class="bold">general approaches</span> to income guarantees but
          try to start thinking about how incomes after benefits would change

          The first model puts a strong emphasis on

          The idea is to determine an income tax threshold below which
          households don’t have to pay income tax. In addition to being an
          allowance, this threshold would also determine the amount of a new tax
          return. For example for every dollar below that threshold, a household
          would receive 50 cents. If the limit is set at &#36;&#8239;24,000 and
          a household has earned &#36;&#8239;12,000 the difference would be
          &#36;&#8239;12,000. The difference multiplied by &#36;&#8239;0.50
          would result in a &#36;&#8239;6,000 tax return or a combined income of
          &#36;&#8239;18,000. Because of this construction, this concept is
          often called a
          <span class="bold">Negative Income Tax (NIT),</span> but other names
          like Basic Income are also sometimes used.

          In tax terminology, we can also think of the rate of &#36;&#8239;0.50
          per dollar less income as a negative marginal tax rate of 50&#8239;%.
          Fifty percent is a value that is often chosen in UIG concepts because
          it is
          <span class="bold">considered a good compromise</span> of the need to
          fade out a benefit with increased earnings and work incentives,
          avoiding the welfare trap (see also the earlier section).

          The next question we need to answer for this model is:
          <span class="bold">What is the right income threshold?</span> When the
          model was conceived, there was no final answer, but instead, an
          approach to compare different outcomes. – First, we would assess how
          much is currently spent on welfare. (Second identify everything that
          can be translated into a cash transfer.) And then calculate the
          outcomes of transforming this amount into a UIG for different income
          thresholds and compare and estimate which one would have a reasonable
          benefit for most people.

          At its conception, one of the main goals of this approach was to

          The second model takes this approach. It is deliberately an open model
          that starts by setting a UIG to
          <span class="bold"
            >&#36;&#8239;1,000 per adult and &#36;&#8239;500 per child per

          This approach also uses the marginal tax rate introduced in the first
          model, but now it’s calculated in the
          <span class="bold">opposite direction.</span> For every dollar earned,
          there is an income tax of 50 cents. The so-called break-even,where the
          UIG benefit equals the income tax, is reached at earnings of
          &#36;&#8239;2,000 per month for one adult.

          The selection of which welfare program is in place is an additional
          function transferred from the first model. As mentioned, we will talk
          about financing in the following section.

          In contrast to the first approach, it is evident that this approach
          adds a significant amount to the overall budget if the income
          guarantee should be above the poverty line. These additional costs
          have to be financed. For proponents of UIGs the idea of
          <span class="bold">printing money,</span> similar to the concept of

          This can pacify fears of massive inflation due to the implementation

            >any honest discussion about an income guarantee following the

          There are various innovative approaches to shared growth. Some involve
          the introduction of <span class="bold">new taxes</span> (land tax,
          carbon tax, robot tax). Others want to create a sovereign wealth fund
          financed by a broad variety of sources (restructuring pensions, social
          insurances and shared profits of the use of common and natural
          resources). There are also voices that emphasize that
          <span class="bold">closing tax loopholes</span> would already finance
          a larger share of a UIG.

            of society and thus in the long term contributing to sustainable
            economic growth. In this regard it is crucial that a UIG is
            acceptable to potential beneficiaries as well as those stakeholders
            who will have to share more, the latter being more likely to have
            greater influence on shaping future policies.</span
