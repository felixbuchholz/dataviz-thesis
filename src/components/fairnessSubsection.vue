          Probably the most challenging question to answer is how to make the
          welfare system fairer. Usually, we would try and agree on a definition
          of fairness first. In this case, it might not be necessary. The notion
          of a universal income guarantee could be general enough that it is
          compatible with different perspectives on fairness.

          Proponents of <span class="bold">poverty reduction,</span> for

          For some proponents, a UIG might be a way to achieve what they regard
          as an acceptable minimal welfare system. Others would strongly
          disagree and see it as an opportunity to share more significant parts
          of economic growth more equally.

          A UIG plan also touches on a belief that is deeply rooted in current
          welfare implementations. The
          <span class="bold"
            >notion that a welfare design has to determine who needs assistance
            and who does not.</span
          >
          An unconditional transfer conceptually doesn’t make this distinction.
          While for proponents of a UIG this is a significant advantage, making
          the transfer a citizen’s right, this point might be the most
          controversial one in the discussions around the idea.

          The question of need can also be rephrased: Who deserves assistance
          and who does not? Even people who do not work right now? Some
          advocates for UIGs welcome this debate hoping that it might open the
          door to <span class="bold">rethink what work means</span> and if all
          work that is done in a society is actually accounted for with fair
          compensation. In this regard, it is often highlighted that an unequal
          share of work in the domestic realm could be compensated with a UIG
          having positive effects on gender equality.

          Other authors emphasize the thought that in our work today, we all
          rely to a large extent on the work that was done by someone else
          before us. The large share of our current productivity is possible due
          to
          <span class="bold">knowledge created by earlier generations,</span>
          the efficiency created by the institutions we work in and not the
          least technological advancements that became part of the Commons.
          These authors suggest that it would be fair, to share more of this

          This is only a fragment of the discussion of the relation between
          social justice and universal income guarantees. But to understand the
          nuances and challenges of a pragmatic implementation, it’s important
          to look at how a UIG would affect incomes.
